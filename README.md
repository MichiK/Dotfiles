MichiK's dotfiles
=================

This is my personal repository of dotfiles that I work with. I keep it here to
have a backup of all my carefully crafted settings and configurations as well
as to be able to quickly get all my stuff set up in a new environment.

Feel free to have a look into all the stuff and use it directly or let it
inspire you for your own work. If you like it and meet me at a conference,
you may buy me a beer.

The dotfiles come with a small set of simple installer shellscripts. After
cloning the repository, just execute `./install.sh` and watch the magic happen.
The script has a few safeguards in place, so in theory, it should not overwrite
any files that are already present. However, please use caution, unforseen
things may happen, so run it at your own risk. No backup, no mercy!

If you discover any problems with the installer script or with the dotfiles
themselves, issues, or even better, pull requests are always welcome.
